## francl_mcdermott_room_simulator

Python interface for using a MATLAB-based virtual acoustic room simulator by Mike O'Connel and Jay Desloge.

Conda environment containing the MATLAB engine for Python: `/om2/user/msaddler/.conda/envs/matlab`.

MATLAB files and HRTFs were copied from `/scratch2/weka/mcdermott/francl/Room_Simulator_20181115_Rebuild`. MATLAB files were minimally modified by msaddler to standardize formatting and enable interfacing with Python (one variable was changed from a char array to a cell array of strings).
